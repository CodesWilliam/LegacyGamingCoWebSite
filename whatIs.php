        <p>Legacy is much more than your average gaming café hosting PC Gaming. You now have many abilities as well as
           options for gaming at the tip of your fingers and at your request as a patron. Some of the things we boast
            are the best graphics in gaming, HD, 4K, and preparing for 4H graphics to ensure we are cutting Edge. Our
            PC’s are Alienware Aurora R8’s that will continually be upgraded once they are outdated in anyway. We are
            hard driven to stay at the top of our industry by keeping the fastest, most powerful PC’s and graphics that
            one can game on. If you want the latest we most likely have it.

            When asking why come to Legacy Gaming if I own a PC, or Console, or even a VR Headset? The answer is quite
            simple. Even having 4K or HD monitors at home, a residence can never offer our speeds, therefore; one would
            never see the full potential of the speed and high performance that the gaming can actually reach!
            Residences are not given business speeds if with running fiber to one’s home. There is a clear cut
            difference to be seen here. It is also a plus to be able to go back and re-evaluate what you claimed sucked
            about the opposing console being it Legacy hosts them all!
