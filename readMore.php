    <div class="whatIsMore">
        <p>Legacy is much more than your average gaming café hosting PC Gaming. You now have many abilities as well as
            options for gaming at the tip of your fingers and at your request as a patron. Some of the things we boast
            are the best graphics in gaming, HD, 4K, and preparing for 4H graphics to ensure we are cutting Edge. Our
            PC’s are Alienware Aurora R8’s that will continually be upgraded once they are outdated in anyway. We are
            hard driven to stay at the top of our industry by keeping the fastest, most powerful PC’s and graphics that
            one can game on. If you want the latest we most likely have it.
        </p>
        <p>
            When asking why come to Legacy Gaming if I own a PC, or Console, or even a VR Headset? The answer is quite
            simple. Even having 4K or HD monitors at home, a residence can never offer our speeds, therefore; one would
            never see the full potential of the speed and high performance that the gaming can actually reach!
            Residences are not given business speeds if with running fiber to one’s home. There is a clear cut
            difference to be seen here. It is also a plus to be able to go back and re-evaluate what you claimed sucked
            about the opposing console being it Legacy hosts them all!
        </p>
        <p>
            Now when it comes to your wants as a Patron it is quite simple…… You ask and we work to make it so our
            owner here at Legacy is an avid Gamer as well so is very tuned into giving what our patrons want. With
            Legacy Gaming being your local Gaming Lounge you have the ability to Blog on our Website and actually
            create your own gaming communities grow them and become tight knit. Once we enter our tournament phase and
            you’ve ranked each other Legacy has more to offer stay tuned…….. As we grow together you will experience
            more than you can imagine as we will be giving back with many perks.

        <h2 class="more">What Legacy Gaming Offers</h2>
            <p>Legacy offers the hottest games out as the Genre is not limited thus allowing our patrons to make their
                gaming experience what they want it each time they return unlike your standard Arcade where the stand-ups
                never move and become boring after an hour. Within a patrons time rental they can op to change games and go
                to a different game as long as time allows but can only change stations once time runs out. We offer the
                ability for you to login to your account and even load your game to play at our speeds. Another good feature
                to love is….If Playstation Network or Xbox live goes down. Legacy is built to switch immediately switch to
                a Lan party hosted and still allow you to play live persons internally or externally. As for the rest….well
                lets not spoil the surprise.
