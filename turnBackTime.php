        <p>Even having the latest and greatest of the gaming consoles we also have everything from the old school
            consoles such as Atari, and Coleco Vision along a timeline that goes all the way up to what we are playing
            now today. There is history to be learned within the walls of Legacy Gaming and we plan to share this
            history with everyone. Each week we will host a different 4 old school consoles games for patrons to play
            until we are able to host them all at once and space allows. The systems can be requested just prior to the
            weekly change as well. We cannot wait to see what you request.
