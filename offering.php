        <p>Legacy offers the hottest games out as the Genre is not limited thus allowing our patrons to make their
            gaming experience what they want it each time they return unlike your standard Arcade where the stand-ups
            never move and become boring after an hour. Within a patrons time rental they can op to change games and go
            to a different game as long as time allows but can only change stations once time runs out. We offer the
            ability for you to login to your account and even load your game to play at our speeds. Another good feature
            to love is….If Playstation Network or Xbox live goes down. Legacy is built to switch immediately switch to
            a Lan party hosted and still allow you to play live persons internally or externally. As for the rest….well
            lets not spoil the surprise.
